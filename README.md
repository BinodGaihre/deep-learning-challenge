# deep-learning-challenge

## Overview
- The project is about creating a deep learning model that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Data Processing
- Among the features in the provided dataset, `IS_SUCCESSFUL` is the target variable, and the output value is used to predict whether the funding was successful.

- `APPLICATION_TYPE`, `AFFILIATION`, `CLASSIFICATION`, `USE_CASE`, `ORGANIZATION`, `STATUS` `INCOME_AMT`, `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`, `ASK_AMT` are the features variable used for the prediction in the model.

- `IN` and `NAME` is the variable that should be removed because they are irrelevant in prediction.
